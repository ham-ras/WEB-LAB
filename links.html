A chart is a graphical representation of worksheet data. Charts can make data interesting, attractive and easy to read and evaluate. They can also help you to analyze and compare data.

7.	Web Browsing Software
"World Wide Web" or simple "Web" is the name given to all the resources of internet. The special software or application program with which you can access web is called "Web Browser".<br>

8.	Configuring Web Browser
Search Engine is an application that allows you to search for content on the web. It displays multiple web pages based on the content or a word you have typed.

9.	Search Engines
Search Engine is an application that allows you to search for content on the web. It displays multiple web pages based on the content or a word you have typed.<br>

10.	Search for the content
Search Engine helps to search for content on web using the different stages<br>

11	Accessing Web Browser
There are several ways to access a web page like using URLs, hyperlinks, using navigating tools, search engine, etc.<br><br>

<h2 id="html">HTML</H2>
The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.<BR>

Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.<BR>

HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.<BR> HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as &lt;img> and &lt;input/> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.<BR>

HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2]<BR>

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]<br><br>

<img src="csslink.jpeg" id="csslink"><br><br>

CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]

The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.

The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.[5]

In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.<br><br>



<h2 id="javascript">JavaScript</h2>
JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.

JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java. JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name LiveScript. The general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.

The ECMA-262 Specification defined a standard version of the core JavaScript language.

JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language.
Designed for creating network-centric applications.
Complementary to and integrated with Java.
Complementary to and integrated with HTML.
Open and cross-platform
Client-Side JavaScript
Client-side JavaScript is the most common form of the language. The script should be included in or referenced by an HTML document for the code to be interpreted by the browser.

It means that a web page need not be a static HTML, but can include programs that interact with the user, control the browser, and dynamically create HTML content.

The JavaScript client-side mechanism provides many advantages over traditional CGI server-side scripts. For example, you might use JavaScript to check if the user has entered a valid e-mail address in a form field.

The JavaScript code is executed when the user submits the form, and only if all the entries are valid, they would be submitted to the Web Server.

JavaScript can be used to trap user-initiated events such as button clicks, link navigation, and other actions that the user initiates explicitly or implicitly.

Advantages of JavaScript
The merits of using JavaScript are −

Less server interaction − You can validate user input before sending the page off to the server. This saves server traffic, which means less load on your server.

Immediate feedback to the visitors − They don't have to wait for a page reload to see if they have forgotten to enter something.

Increased interactivity − You can create interfaces that react when the user hovers over them with a mouse or activates them via the keyboard.

Richer interfaces − You can use JavaScript to include such items as drag-and-drop components and sliders to give a Rich Interface to your site visitors.

Limitations of JavaScript
We cannot treat JavaScript as a full-fledged programming language. It lacks the following important features −

Client-side JavaScript does not allow the reading or writing of files. This has been kept for security reason.

JavaScript cannot be used for networking applications because there is no such support available.

JavaScript doesn't have any multi-threading or multiprocessor capabilities.

Once again, JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language that allows you to build interactivity into otherwise static HTML pages.

<h2 id ="rdbms">RDBMS</h2><br>
A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a collection of programs and capabilities that enable IT teams and others to create, update, administer and otherwise interact with a relational database. RDBMSes store data in the form of tables, with most commercial relational database management systems using Structured Query Language (SQL) to access the database. However, since SQL was invented after the initial development of the relational model, it is not necessary for RDBMS use.

The RDBMS is the most popular database system among organizations across the world. It provides a dependable method of storing and retrieving large amounts of data while offering a combination of system performance and ease of implementation.

RDBMS vs. DBMS
In general, databases store sets of data that can be queried for use in other applications. A database management system supports the development, administration and use of database platforms.

An RDBMS is a type of database management system (DBMS) that stores data in a row-based table structure which connects related data elements. An RDBMS includes functions that maintain the security, accuracy, integrity and consistency of the data. This is different than the file storage used in a DBMS.

Other differences between database management systems and relational database management systems include:

Number of allowed users. While a DBMS can only accept one user at a time, an RDBMS can operate with multiple users.
Hardware and software requirements. A DBMS needs less software and hardware than an RDBMS.
Amount of data. RDBMSes can handle any amount of data, from small to large, while a DBMS can only manage small amounts.
Database structure. In a DBMS, data is kept in a hierarchical form, whereas an RDBMS utilizes a table where the headers are used as column names and the rows contain the corresponding values.
ACID implementation. DBMSes do not use the atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability (ACID) model for storing data. On the other hand, RDBMSes base the structure of their data on the ACID model to ensure consistency.
Distributed databases. While an RDBMS offers complete support for distributed databases, a DBMS will not provide support.
Types of programs managed. While an RDBMS helps manage the relationships between its incorporated tables of data, a DBMS focuses on maintaining databases that are present within the computer network and system hard disks.
Support of database normalization. An RDBMS can be normalized, but a DBMS cannot.<br><br>

<img src="php.png" id="php"><br><br>
PHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared towards web development.[7] It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994.[8] The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group.[9] PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page,[8] but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.[10]<br>

PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code – which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data – would form the whole or part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist which can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside the web context, such as standalone graphical applications[11] and robotic drone control. PHP code can also be directly executed from the command line.<br>

The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on a variety of operating systems and platforms.<br>

The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014, with the original implementation acting as the de facto standard which other implementations aimed to follow. Since 2014, work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification.<br>

<h2 id="debug">Debugging web apps </h2>
<pre>
You can debug your JavaScript using the console JavaScript APIs and view the output messages to logcat. If you're familiar with debugging web pages with Firebug or Web Inspector, then you're probably familiar with using console (such as console.log()). Android's WebKit framework supports most of the same APIs, so you can receive logs from your web page when debugging in your WebView. This topic describes how to use the console APIs for debugging.<br>

Note: You can also remotely debug your web pages in WebView with Chrome Developer Tools. For more information, see Remote debugging on Android.<br>
Using console APIs in WebView
All the console APIs shown in the previous section are also supported when debugging in WebView. You must provide a WebChromeClient that implements the onConsoleMessage() method in order for console messages to appear in logcat. Then, apply the WebChromeClient to your WebView with setWebChromeClient().<br>

The following shows how to use console APIs in WebView:

Kotlin
Java

val myWebView: WebView = findViewById(R.id.webview)<br>
myWebView.webChromeClient = object : WebChromeClient() {
<br>
    override fun onConsoleMessage(message: ConsoleMessage): Boolean {
        Log.d("MyApplication", "${message.message()} -- From line " +
              "${message.lineNumber()} of ${message.sourceID()}")
        return true
    }
}
The ConsoleMessage also includes a MessageLevel object to indicate the type of console message being delivered. You can query the message level with messageLevel() to determine the severity of the message, then use the appropriate Log method or take other appropriate actions.

Whether you're using onConsoleMessage(String, int, String) or onConsoleMessage(ConsoleMessage), when you execute a console method in your web page, Android calls the appropriate onConsoleMessage() method so you can report the error. For instance, with the example code above, a logcat message is printed that looks like this:


Hello World -- From line 82 of http://www.example.com/hello.html
Warning: Don't include personally-identifiable information (PII) in console messages.
Logcat
Logcat is a tool that dumps a log of system messages. The messages include a stack trace when the device throws an error, as well as log messages written from your application and those written using JavaScript console APIs.

To run logcat and view messages from Android Studio, select View > Tool Windows > Logcat.

For more information, see Write and view logs with logcat.
